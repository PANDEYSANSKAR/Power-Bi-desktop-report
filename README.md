# Power-Bi-desktop-report
Here I made a report for Adventure works cycle company using Power Bi desktop
The situation - You’ve just been hired by Adventure Works Cycles*, a global manufacturing company, to 
design and deliver an end-to-end business intelligence solution – from scratch!

The Brief - Your client needs a way to track KPIs (sales, revenue, profit, returns), compare regional 
performance, analyze product-level trends and forecasts, and identify high-value customers
All you’ve been given is a folder of raw csv files, containing information about transactions, 
returns, products, customers and territories

The Objective -
Use Power BI Desktop to: 
• Connect and transform the raw data
• Build a relational data model
• Create new calculated columns and DAX measures
• Design an interactive report to analyze and visualize the data


Also a huge shoutout to udemy's Power BI desktop course for guidance.
